# Digital-Trade-Analysis
This project, named Digital Trade Analysis, is a data analysis and visualization effort focused on understanding international trade in digitally-deliverable services. It utilizes a dataset from the World Bank to explore global export and import trends and the relationship between them.

Key Features

- Data Import and Cleaning: The project uses Python with pandas to load and prepare the raw data for analysis.
- Trend Analysis: It visualizes and analyzes global trends in both exports and imports of digitally-deliverable services over time. The analysis reveals a significant widening of the gap between exports and imports after 2020, with exports showing stronger growth.
- Correlation Visualization: A scatter plot is generated to show the positive correlation between exports and imports across different countries and regions, suggesting that countries actively involved in global trade tend to participate on both the export and import sides.
- Key Findings: The analysis concludes that digitally-deliverable services are a major driver of trade and are resilient to disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is Trade_analysis_data.csv. This data originates from the World Bank's WB.DATA360 database.

Technologies Used

- Python: The core programming language for the analysis.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
